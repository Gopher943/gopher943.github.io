<img src="/images/clap.png" width="30px" height="30px"> Welcome and thank you for visiting my site! I am currently a PH.D. student in [Zhejiang University of Technology](https://www.zjut.edu.cn/). I joined the Data Visualization Group at Zhejiang University of Technology [(ZjutVis)](https://zjutvis.org/) in 2020 and under the supervision of [Prof. Ronghua Liang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fbvnBG4AAAAJ&hl=en) and [A/Prof. Guodao Sun](https://godoorsun.org/). And I am currently a visiting student at¬†[Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/index.html)¬†and a member of the¬†[Dream Lab](https://www.xiameng.org/DreamLab/), supervised by [Prof. Xia](https://www.xiameng.org/).

I'm interested in exploring large data using interactive visual analytics. At present, my research focus is developing interactive <strong>visual analytics</strong> approaches for analyzing <strong>video data (associated with education technology)</strong>.                   
üëÄ Please feel free to look around and contact me if you have any comments!
