# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am Gefei Zhang!
I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in [Zhejiang University of Technology](https://www.zjut.edu.cn/) and a visiting scholar at [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/index.html). My academic journey includes being a core member of the Data Visualization Group [(ZjutVis)](https://zjutvis.org/) since 2020, where I work under the supervision of [Prof. Ronghua Liang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fbvnBG4AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Guodao Sun](https://godoorsun.org/). At Texas A&M University, I am privileged to be part of the [Dream Lab](https://www.xiameng.org/DreamLab/), working with [Prof. Xia](https://www.xiameng.org/).

My research lies at the intersection of Visual Analytics, Human-Computer Interaction, and Education Technology. Specifically, I focus on:
- **Visual Analytics**: Developing interactive approaches for large-scale data analysis
- **Education Technology**: Exploring the application of visual analytics in educational contexts

The overarching goal of my research is to bridge the gap between complex data analysis and intuitive understanding through innovative visualization approaches.

ðŸ‘€ If you are interested in my research, please feel free to contact me via <a href="mailto:gefei@zjut.edu.cn"> gefei [at] zjut.edu.cn</a>.

More information will be update soon~
